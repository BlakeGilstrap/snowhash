# SnowHash

Procedurally generate a unique snowflake from a hash.

To be implemented...

The goal is eventually to have some library functions, a PNG generator, and be able to compile this project to WASM to be used on joshleeb.com.

## Acknowledgement

This project is based on [Snowflake][snowflake] by Raph Levein which is "an implementation of procedural generation of snowflakes."
